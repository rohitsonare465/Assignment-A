curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=math"
# Expected: Returns 3 courses with "math" in title/description
# Response includes: Math Adventures, Advanced Mathematics, Math Olympiad

# 2. Get API documentation
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search/help"
# Expected: Complete parameter reference and examples

# 3. Search all courses (no filters)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search"
# Expected: Returns first 10 courses (total: 51) sorted by upcoming date
```

#### Filtering Examples

```bash
# 4. Filter by category
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?category=Science"
# Expected: Returns ~8 science courses
# Response includes: Science Spectacular, Chemistry Lab, Physics Fun, etc.

# 5. Filter by course type
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?type=ONE_TIME"

# 6. Age range filtering
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?minAge=10&maxAge=15"
# Expected: Returns courses suitable for ages 10-15
# Filters courses where age range overlaps with 10-15

# 7. Price range filtering
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?minPrice=50&maxPrice=100"
# Expected: Returns courses priced between $50-$100
# Response excludes very cheap (<$50) and expensive (>$100) courses

# Expected: Returns 5 cheapest courses
# First course should be "Magic Show Spectacular" ($15)

# 10. Sort by price (descending)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?sort=priceDesc&size=5"
# Expected: Returns 5 most expensive courses
# First course should be "Robotics Engineering Club" ($180)

# Expected: Returns courses 6-10 with pagination metadata
# Response: currentPage=1, hasNext=true, hasPrevious=true

# 14. Large page size
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?size=20"
# Expected: Returns 20 courses (or all if fewer than 20 match)
# Response: Shows impact on totalPages calculation
```

#### Advanced Filtering Examples

```bash
# 15. Date filtering (courses starting after specific date)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?startDate=2025-07-01&sort=upcoming"
# Expected: Returns courses starting July 1st, 2025 or later
# Response excludes June 2025 courses

```

### Expected Response Format

All `/api/search` responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "total": 51,
  "courses": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Math Adventures for Little Explorers",
      "category": "Math",
      "price": 85.0,
      "nextSessionDate": "2025-06-10T15:00:00Z",
      "description": "Fun and interactive math activities...",
      "type": "COURSE",
      "gradeRange": "K-2nd",
      "minAge": 5,
      "maxAge": 7
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 0,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "totalPages": 6,
    "hasNext": true,
    "hasPrevious": false
  }
}
```

### Expected Behaviors

#### Sorting Behavior
- **`upcoming`** (default): Sorts by `nextSessionDate` ascending (earliest first)
- **`priceAsc`**: Sorts by `price` ascending (cheapest first)

- **Age filtering**: Finds courses where age ranges overlap with requested range
- **Price filtering**: Exact range matching on course price
- **Category/Type**: Exact string matching (case-sensitive)
- **Date filtering**: Includes courses starting on or after the specified date

#### Pagination Behavior
- **`page`**: Zero-based indexing (0 = first page)
- **`size`**: Number of results per page (default: 10, max recommended: 100)
- **Metadata**: Includes navigation helpers (`hasNext`, `hasPrevious`)

      "description": "Fun and interactive math activities...",
      "type": "COURSE",
      "gradeRange": "K-2nd",
      "minAge": 5,
      "maxAge": 7
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 0,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "totalPages": 6,
    "hasNext": true,
    "hasPrevious": false
  }
}
```

### Expected Behaviors

#### Sorting Behavior
- **`upcoming`** (default): Sorts by `nextSessionDate` ascending (earliest first)
- **`priceAsc`**: Sorts by `price` ascending (cheapest first)
- **`priceDesc`**: Sorts by `price` descending (most expensive first)

#### Filtering Behavior
- **Text search** (`q`): Searches both `title` and `description` fields
- **Age filtering**: Finds courses where age ranges overlap with requested range
- **Price filtering**: Exact range matching on course price
- **Category/Type**: Exact string matching (case-sensitive)
- **Date filtering**: Includes courses starting on or after the specified date

#### Pagination Behavior
- **`page`**: Zero-based indexing (0 = first page)
- **`size`**: Number of results per page (default: 10, max recommended: 100)
- **Metadata**: Includes navigation helpers (`hasNext`, `hasPrevious`)

### Automated Testing Script

Run the comprehensive test suite that verifies all API functionality:

```bash
# Make the script executable and run all tests
chmod +x test-api.sh
./test-api.sh
```

- âœ… Basic search functionality (keyword, category, type filters)
- âœ… Age range and price range filtering  
- âœ… All sorting options (upcoming, priceAsc, priceDesc)
- âœ… Pagination with different page sizes
- âœ… Complex multi-parameter queries
- âœ… Edge cases (empty results, non-existent categories)
- âœ… Autocomplete functionality
- âœ… Legacy endpoint compatibility
- âœ… Performance measurement

**Expected Test Results:**
- All 19 test cases should pass âœ…
- Response times should be under 100ms for most queries
- Total course count: 51 courses across 10 categories
- Autocomplete should return 3-4 suggestions for "art" and "math"

# Very high price filter
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?minPrice=500"
# Expected: {"total":0,"courses":[],"pagination":{...}}
```

#### Invalid Parameters
```bash
# Invalid sort parameter (falls back to default)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?sort=invalidSort"
# Expected: Results sorted by upcoming date (default behavior)

# Invalid page number (returns empty but valid response)
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?page=999"
# Expected: {"total":51,"courses":[],"pagination":{...}}
```

### 12. Response Format Validation

Every `/api/search` response follows this exact structure:

```json
{
  "total": 51,
  "courses": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Math Adventures for Little Explorers",
      "category": "Math", 
      "price": 85.0,
      "nextSessionDate": "2025-06-10T15:00:00Z",
      "description": "Fun and interactive math activities...",
      "type": "COURSE",
      "gradeRange": "K-2nd",
      "minAge": 5,
      "maxAge": 7
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "currentPage": 0,
    "pageSize": 10,
    "totalPages": 6,
    "hasNext": true,
    "hasPrevious": false
  }
}
```

#### Required Response Fields:
- âœ… `total`: Total number of matching courses
- âœ… `courses`: Array of course objects with all required fields
- âœ… `pagination`: Complete pagination metadata

### 13. Autocomplete Testing

#### Autocomplete Suggestions
```bash
# Get suggestions for "art"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/courses/autocomplete?query=art"
# Expected: ["Young Artists Club","Origami Art Workshop","Martial Arts Introduction","Knitting and Fiber Arts"]

# Get suggestions for "math"  
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/courses/autocomplete?query=math"
# Expected: ["Math Adventures for Little Explorers","Advanced Mathematics Challenge","Math Olympiad Preparation"]

# Get suggestions for "science"
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/courses/autocomplete?query=science"
# Expected: Multiple science-related course titles
```

#### Expected Autocomplete Behavior:
- âœ… Returns array of course titles (not full course objects)
- âœ… Matches based on course title
- âœ… Limited to relevant suggestions (typically 3-5 results)
- âœ… Fast response time for real-time suggestions
